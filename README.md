# ultrasonic_sensor_and_digital_circuit
this repository contain two projects the first is digital circuit that use pull up and pull down structure and the second is designing ultrasonic sensor.

# Digital Circuit 
## pull up and pull down circuit
here I designed a circuit that use the two expression pull up and pull down. 
### Left of the circuit
left of the circuit I use pull up so that the led will be off unless I push the switch.
### Right of the circuit
Right of the circuit I use pull down so that the led will be on unless I push the switch.

# Ultrasonic sensor
here I design circuit with the ultrasonic sensor so when the distance lower than 50in the led will go high as a signal of closeness and when the distance more than 50in it the LED will turn off.
